# HangingSloth

A classic hangman experience built with UIKit. It selects a word randomly from a list, presenting it to the user as a series of underscores. Players guess letters, with correct guesses revealing them in the word, while incorrect ones bring the sloth closer to escaping. Win by guessing the word or lose after seven incorrect guesses. Hints gradually reveal with each incorrect selection.

Technologies: Anchors, Autolayout, JSONDecoder, Codable, NSMutableAttributedString, compactMap
